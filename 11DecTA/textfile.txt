I've always had good intuition (yeah)
And I can see red flags in your eyes (yeah)
So you can keep on talkin', baby
All that you want (yeah)
'Cause you're my only entertainment tonight
Empty conversations
Endless irritation
You must think that I'm off my head
And that you've taken over my mind
I'm losin' my patience
Got me so frustrated
You must be so confident
Thinkin' that I'm gonna give you my time
And let you
Take all that you want from me
Try and leave me with nothin'
That shit don't faze me
What kind of girl you take me for?
I don't need your petty company
Least I know you're good for somethin'
You entertain me
Go on and entertain me, boy
The stage is yours, so why don't you take it? (Yeah)
I'm sure that you've rehearsed all your lines (yeah)
But can you keep me guessin', not be, so obvious (yeah)
And prove that I was wrong the whole time
Empty conversations
Endless irritation
You must think that I'm off my head
And that you've taken over my mind
I'm losin' my patience
Got me so frustrated
You must be so confident
Thinkin' that I'm gonna give you my time
And let you
Take all that you want from me
Try and leave me with nothin
That shit don't faze me

You entertain me
Go on and entertain me, boy
Go on and entertain me, boy
I hear it all the time
Pretty little lies
Anythin' you'll try
I hear it all the time
Pretty little lies
Anythin' you'll try
But I won't let you
Take all that you want from me (from me)
Try and leave me with nothin'
That shit don't faze me (shit don't faze me)
